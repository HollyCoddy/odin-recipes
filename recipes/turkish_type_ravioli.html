    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is one of the oldest dishes of Turkish Cuisine which originated from a far away place in Central Asia. It is favored and well-known among the Turks all over the world. In the original recipes mantıs are prepared in tiny froms. These tiny mantıs are simmered in water into which tomato paste is added. It is called "Çöçöre" by Central Asian Turks. It is time consuming to prepare and yet it tasty and delicious. The dish is served as a one course meal. When mantis are simmered, they are sometimes left in liquid. Yogurt-garlic mixture is blended into it. It is served with tomato sauce again. In winter months melted butter-red pepper mixture is sprinkled over.When mantıs are drained, leftover liquid is used in making soups. In Bolu province crushed walnuts-hard cheese mixture is sprinkled over.  In some recipes 2-3 tabespoons of tomato paste is added to the boiling water before mantıs are stirred in. This dish is called "Tatar Böregi" in some regions which means "Tatar's Börek". The baked from is called mantı. Before stirring in boiling water mantıs can be baked in a moderate oven until golden  brown. Then hot broth is poured over, and simmered until tender. Served with yogurt and tomato sauce.</p>
